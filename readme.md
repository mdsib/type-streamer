#Type Streamer
Type for a long time without making mistakes and track your speed.

My motivation for making this comes from typinglessons.com, which emphasizes typing without mistakes as the most critical aspect to improving typing speed. I've found myself wanting a typing program that would be:
* Continuous
* Emphasizing errorless typing by design (success measured by lack of mistakes...)
* Customizable (enable/disable keys, change penalty for errors)
* Connected (high scores for most keys / words typed error free)
* Detailed statistics on typing speed and errors over time

##Running Locally
* Install npm modules via `npm install`  
* `npm start` will build the app and run it
* access at `localhost:8080`

##Running Tests
Type Streamer uses mocha, chai, and jsdom to run unit tests. Run with `npm test`
