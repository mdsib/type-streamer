#Type Streamer
Type for a long time without making mistakes and track your speed.

My motivation for making this comes from typinglessons.com, which emphasizes typing without mistakes as the most critical aspect to improving type speed. I've found myself wanting a typing program that would be:
* Continuous
* Emphasizing errorless typing by design (success measured by lack of mistakes...)
* Customizable (enable/disable keys, change penalty for errors)
* Connected (high scores for most keys / words typed error free)
* Detailed statistics on typing speed and errors over time

So I'm making it.
